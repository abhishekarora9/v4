Hello! I'm Abhishek.I recognise myself as a NLP researcher and an avid software engineer, acquiring and developing my skills for the past decade in the same. I am currently working as a Research Engineer at [Product Labs, IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) for the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research under [Prof. Manish Shrivastava](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en) to build market ready products.

I did my Bachelor of Engineering from [Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology - NSIT](http://www.nsit.ac.in/) (now NSUT), Delhi where I was guided by [Dr. K.P.S Rana](https://sites.google.com/site/kpsrana1/home) under whom I completed my Bachelor Thesis which focussed on developing a novel optimisation algorithm to efficiently track the MPPT of a photo-voltaic system(Currently under Journal Review) . After graduating in 2019, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Hindustan Times - HT Digital in the Data Engineering team. My applied research Internship at TCIL focussed on application of Deep Learning techniques to solve real life problems in the domain of Telecommunication. I worked as a Research Intern at IIT-Delhi in the Dept. of Biochemical Engineering under [Prof. Ravikrishnan Elangovan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=S0bNQswAAAAJ) to build a mathematical model to increase the diagnose rate (currently ~55% in India) so as to eradicate Tuberculosis by 2025.

Speaking of my passion for coding, I was the youngest Grand Prize winner in Google Code-In 2011, securing a 2nd position among 542 students from 56 countries. Apart from this, I like to leisure around with my free time with gobbling up any new Movies or TV/Web-series that I can find which I find intriguing.

Academically I have been a consistent performer. I was awarded the Gold Medal and a 6 year scholar award at my alma matar (DPS Rohini) with 94.6% in class XII. At my college I graduated with first class and distinction (Hons.) engineering degree with a CGPA of 8.61.
